      "of people related by blood or marriage, adoption and\n",
      "sharing residence. A family began to denote the father,\n",
      "mother and children in the late 17* century. There are quite\n",
      "a number of definitions for the family. For instance, Stack\n",
      "(1996) defined ‘family’ as “the smallest, organized, durable\n",
      "network of kin and non-kin who interact daily, providing\n",
      "domestic needs of children and assuring their survival.”\n",
      "McDanieletal. (2005) also defined family as any group of\n",
      "people related either biologically, emotionally, or legally.\n",
      "Historically, the 'family' was described as married partners\n",
      "and their children. The family is a universal institution, it is\n",
      "generally acceptable all over the world. Biblically, God\n",
      "instituted family when he brought Eve to Adam in the\n",
